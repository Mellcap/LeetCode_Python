# 648. Replace Words

```
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:

Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"


Note:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= root length <= 100
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000
```

## My Solution (Using Trie)

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = {}


    def _insert_trie(self, word: str) -> None:
        """
        Insert trie which skips the longer word which has the same prefix, e.g. only set `cat` when given [`cat`, `catone`, `cats`]
        """
        curr_trie = self.trie
        for c in word:
            # skip if there is a shortest prefix
            if '#' in curr_trie:
                break
            if c not in curr_trie:
                curr_trie[c] = {}
            curr_trie = curr_trie[c]
        curr_trie['#'] = {}


    def _matched_prefix(self, word: str) -> str:
        """
        Return matched prefix if matched, else return the origin word.
        """
        curr_trie = self.trie
        for index, c in enumerate(word):
            if '#' in curr_trie:
                return word[:index]
            if c not in curr_trie:
                return word
            curr_trie = curr_trie[c]
        return word



    def replaceWords(self, dict: List[str], sentence: str) -> str:
        result_sentence = []
        for word in dict:
            self._insert_trie(word)
        for word in sentence.split():
            matched_prefix = self._matched_prefix(word)
            result_sentence.append(matched_prefix)
        return ' '.join(result_sentence)


```
