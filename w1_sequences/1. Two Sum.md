# 1. Two Sum

```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Idea

Using hashtable to store the key, and see if  the `target - item` in the hashtable.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_dict = {}
        for index, item in enumerate(nums):
            if target - item in num_dict:
                return [index, num_dict.get(target - item)]
            else:
                num_dict[item] = index
```
