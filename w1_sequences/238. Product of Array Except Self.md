# 238. Product of Array Except Self

```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)
```

## Idea

The idea is use 2 lists to store the product of the left nums and the right nums, and calculate the product of 2 sides.

The advanced way is to use only a list, full explaniation is at [Official Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/solution/)

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        nums_length = len(nums)
        self.ans = [0] * nums_length
        self.ans[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, nums_length):
            # self.ans[i] stores the product of left its nums
            self.ans[i] = self.ans[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
        right = 1
        for i in range(nums_length - 1, -1, -1):
            self.ans[i] = self.ans[i] * right
            right = right * nums[i]
        return self.ans
```
