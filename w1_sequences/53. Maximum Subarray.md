# 53. Maximum Subarray

```
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
```

## Idea

at some point, just need to decided to add the previous nums or start from here.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        self.ans = curr_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            curr_sum = max(curr_sum + nums[i], nums[i])
            self.ans = max(curr_sum, self.ans)
        return self.ans
```
