# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

```
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```


## Idea

the brute-force is to check every pair of prices, which is O(n^2).

we can store the max temp_profit at each step, and calculate the maximum of the current difference and the sum of diff and temp_profit.

========

Similar as [53. Maximum Subarray](53.%20Maximum%20Subarray.md)

We only care about the maximum of (*i th* - *i-1 th*) & (*i th* - *i-1 th* + OPT(i-1))


## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        self.ans = 0
        temp_profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            temp_profit = max(prices[i] - prices[i-1], prices[i] - prices[i-1] + temp_profit)
            if temp_profit > self.ans:
                self.ans = temp_profit
        return self.ans
```
