# 11. Container With Most Water

```
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

## Idea

先取两边，然后移动两边试图让面积增加。

因为面积由最短边来决定，所以移动长边没有意义，只会让底边变短。所以我们要移动短边。


## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area, left, right = 0, 0, len(height) - 1
        while left < right:
            max_area = max(max_area, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left))
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return max_area
```
