# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

```
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
```

## Idea

My code is my own idea, using binary search.

set the base line at nums[0].

If mid > nums[0], then the smallest on right, else on left.

But need to take node we use `while left <= right`, using <= rather < is because we are finding the smallest in the  interval of left and right, maybe left and right encounter at the smallest point.


## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        self.ans = nums[0]
        div_num, left, right = nums[0], 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] < div_num:
                self.ans = min(self.ans, nums[mid])
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return self.ans
```
