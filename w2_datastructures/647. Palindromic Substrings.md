# 647. Palindromic Substrings

```
Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.

The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".


Example 2:

Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

## Idea

Find every string, and expand to find all palindromic substring. Note there exist odd and even palindromic.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        self.ans = 0
        self.s = s
        for i in range(len(s)):
            self.count(i, i) # odd palidromic
            self.count(i, i + 1) # even palidromic
        return self.ans

    def count(self, left, right):
        while (left >= 0 and right < len(self.s) and self.s[left] == self.s[right]):
            self.ans += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
```
