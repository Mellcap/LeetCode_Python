# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

```
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
Note:

Given n will always be valid.
```

## Reference

[Leetcode official](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/solution/)


## Idea

Create 2 pointer, right is n steps ahead of left, move together, when right reaches end, remove the next node of left.

**NOTE:** In case remove the first node, we need to create a dummy node which can make code easier.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        left_p, right_p = dummy, dummy
        for i in range(n):
            right_p = right_p.next

        while right_p and right_p.next:
            left_p = left_p.next
            right_p = right_p.next

        left_p.next = left_p.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
