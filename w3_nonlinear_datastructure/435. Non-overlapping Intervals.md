# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

```
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.



Example 1:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.


Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
```

## Reference

[435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://github.com/grandyang/leetcode/issues/435)

## Idea

按起点排序，用last指向当前比较点，然后loop。

如果last[1]比当前点的起点[0]大，则有overlap，self.ans += 1，去掉终点更远的点（因为更有可能和后面overlap），代码上我们只是保持last不变来隐式去掉当前点。

否则我们把last更新到当前点，和后面继续做比较。

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])
        self.ans, last = 0, 0
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[last][1] > intervals[i][0]:
                self.ans += 1
                if intervals[last][1] > intervals[i][1]:
                    last = i
            else:
                last = i
        return self.ans
```
