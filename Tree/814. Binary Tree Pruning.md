# 814. Binary Tree Pruning

```
We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.

(Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def pruneTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def containsOne(node):
            if not node:
                return False
            left_node = containsOne(node.left)
            right_node = containsOne(node.right)
            if not left_node:
                node.left = None
            if not right_node:
                node.right = None
            return node.val == 1 or left_node or right_node

        return root if containsOne(root) else None
```
