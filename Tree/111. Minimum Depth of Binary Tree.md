# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree

```
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        l_depth = self.minDepth(root.left)
        r_depth = self.minDepth(root.right)
        return (l_depth + r_depth + 1) if (l_depth == 0 or r_depth == 0) else (min(l_depth, r_depth) + 1)
```
