# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

```
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def max_depth_helper(node, depth):
            if not node:
                return depth
            return max(max_depth_helper(node.left, depth+1), max_depth_helper(node.right, depth+1))
        return max_depth_helper(root, 0)

```
