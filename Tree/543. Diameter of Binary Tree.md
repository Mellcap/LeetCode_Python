# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

```
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Idea

Remember to update `ans` when we are in the recursion.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.ans = 0
        self.diameterHelper(root)
        return self.ans

    def diameterHelper(self, node):
        if not node:
            return -1
        l_length = self.diameterHelper(node.left) + 1
        r_length = self.diameterHelper(node.right) + 1
        self.ans = max(self.ans, l_length + r_length)
        return max(l_length, r_length)
```
