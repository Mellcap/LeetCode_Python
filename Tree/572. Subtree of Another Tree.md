# 572. Subtree of Another Tree

```
Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:
Given tree s:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
Given tree t:
   4
  / \
 1   2
Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
Example 2:
Given tree s:

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
Given tree t:
   4
  / \
 1   2
Return false.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubtree(self, s: TreeNode, t: TreeNode) -> bool:
        return s is not None and (self.is_same_tree(s, t) or self.isSubtree(s.left, t) or self.isSubtree(s.right, t))

    def is_same_tree(self, node1, node2):
        if not node1 and not node2:
            return True
        if not node1 or not node2:
            return False
```
