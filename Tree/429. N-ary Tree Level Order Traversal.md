# 429. N-ary Tree Level Order Traversal

```
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

We should return its level order traversal:

[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]


Note:

The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
```

## Idea

My solution is same as [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](102.&#32;Binary&#32;Tree&#32;Level&#32;Order&#32;Traversal.md), but there is a faster way I am not really understand why it is fast.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: 'Node') -> List[List[int]]:
        self.ans = []
        if not root:
            return self.ans

        queue = [root]
        while queue:
            queue_length = len(queue)
            sub_list = []
            for i in range(queue_length):
                node = queue[i]
                if node.children:
                    queue.extend(node.children)
                sub_list.append(node.val)
            queue = queue[queue_length:]
            self.ans.append(sub_list)

        return self.ans
```
