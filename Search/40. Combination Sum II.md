# 40. Combination Sum II

```
Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5,
A solution set is:
[
  [1,2,2],
  [5]
]
```

## Idea

Key idea is using [DFS](../Search/DFS_Permutation&Combination.md), and remvoe the duplicate in **this level**,

for example, as the picture below you can see the second **1** at 1st level is duplicate, which needed to be remove.

![](../assets/40.combination_sum_2.png)

```
candidates = [1, 1, 6, 7], target = 8.

1st level: start_index = 0, i = 0, 1, 2, 3. when i = 0, we add **1**, when i = 1, we skip the 2nd **1**.
2st level: when start_index = 1, we still add the 2nd **1**.
So we didn't miss anything, and removed the duplicate.
```

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.ans = []
        candidates.sort()
        candidates_length = len(candidates)

        def combination_helper(start_index, remain_target, curr):
            if remain_target == 0:
                self.ans.append(curr[:])
            for i in range(start_index, candidates_length):
                item = candidates[i]
                if (i > start_index and item == candidates[i - 1]):
                    # remove duplicate in this level
                    continue
                if item > remain_target:
                    break
                curr.append(item)
                combination_helper(i+1, remain_target - item, curr)
                curr.pop()

        combination_helper(0, target, [])
        return self.ans
```
