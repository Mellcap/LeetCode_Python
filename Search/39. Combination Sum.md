# 39. Combination Sum

```
Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```

## Idea

The key idea is not repeat itself, so using **start_index** to avoid repeat itself.

At first I didn't add start_index, then the result of Example 1 returns `[2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2, 2], [7]`.

So adding start_index can keep looping the item in the current item and so forth.



## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.ans = []
        candidates_length = len(candidates)

        def combination_helper(combination: List[int], remain_target: int, start_index: int):
            if remain_target == 0:
                self.ans.append(combination[:])
            else:
                for i in range(start_index, candidates_length):
                    item = candidates[i]
                    if item <= remain_target:
                        combination.append(item)
                        remain_target -= item
                        combination_helper(combination, remain_target, i)
                        # recover
                        combination.pop()
                        remain_target += item

        combination_helper([], target, 0)
        return self.ans
```

There is a [faster solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/discuss/416183/Python-dfs-32-ms-faster-than-98.73)

```python
def combinationSum(self, candidates, target):
        """
        :type candidates: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        ans = []
        candidates = sorted(candidates)
        def dfs(nums, curr_set, curr_sum):
            for i in range(len(nums)):
                temp_sum = nums[i] + curr_sum
                if temp_sum == target:
                    ans.append(curr_set + [nums[i]])
                elif temp_sum > target:
                    return
                else:
                    dfs(nums[i:], curr_set + [nums[i]], temp_sum)

        dfs(candidates, [], 0)

        return ans

# Sort first.
# No repeated combination will be explored here. The only repeation of the number you need to take care of is the existing one. When you do recursion, only need to recurse with the rst candidates including yout self, no need to consider the previous candidates.
