# 943. Find the Shortest Superstring - HARD

```
Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each string in A as a substring.

We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.


Example 1:

Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12
1 <= A[i].length <= 20
```
